> Data science project with the goal of deploying a profitable market trading algorithm on the real stock and/or FOREX market with real money to generate passive income.


## Plan
### Phase 1 _(current)_
Development will start with getting a baseline solution working from start to finish, based on a fairly simple trading algorithm such as *moving average crossover*. This solution should allow for easily backtesting a provided trading strategy and returning back profitability and other performance metrics.

### Phase 2
The next phase will consist of applying more advanced techniques, in particular transformers, for the trading algorithm, potentially with a reinforcement learning component as well and testing its performance against the baseline.

### Phase 3
Once a trading algorithm which is consistently profitable is found, I will deploy the algorithm on a live market with real funds and track the returns, with the ultimate goal being of achieving returns that will cover a nice little passive side income.
